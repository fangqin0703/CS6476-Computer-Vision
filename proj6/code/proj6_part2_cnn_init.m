% [copied from the project webpage]
% proj6_part2_cnn_init.m will start with net = load('imagenet-vgg-f.mat');
% and then edit the network rather than specifying the structure from
% scratch.

% You need to make the following edits to the network: The final two
% layers, fc8 and the softmax layer, should be removed and specified again
% using the same syntax seen in Part 1. The original fc8 had an input data
% depth of 4096 and an output data depth of 1000 (for 1000 ImageNet
% categories). We need the output depth to be 15, instead. The weights can
% be randomly initialized just like in Part 1.

% The dropout layers used to train VGG-F are missing from the pretrained
% model (probably because they're not used at test time). It's probably a
% good idea to add one or both of them back in between fc6 and fc7 and
% between fc7 and fc8.
